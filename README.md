üåë Moon Thief: AI-Powered Exoplanet Discovery Simulator üöÄ
An Unprecedented Synthesis of Deep Learning, Big Data, and Cinematic 3D Visualization.

(This project was developed for the CBSE Class 11 Innovation Challenge, focusing on high Impact, Creativity, and Scientific Validity.)

‚ú® Project Overview: The Revolution in Exoplanet Hunting
Moon Thief is the revolutionary AI concept that's hacking cosmic discovery! It unleashes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based classifier on massive NASA data, translating raw signals into an explorable, high-fidelity 3D simulation. This tool accelerates the scientific process by instantly classifying exoplanet candidates and presenting results with compelling, physically accurate visualizations.

üí° Key Concepts & Technical Feasibility
This project is grounded in cutting-edge technology and established scientific principles:

Structured Algorithmic AI (CNN Principles): The core classification system mimics a Deep Learning architecture, trained on verified NASA Exoplanet Archive data to provide crucial confidence scores for all candidates.

Scientific Validity: The entire simulation is driven by accurate Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion, ensuring all orbital speeds and paths are physically correct.

Creative Visualization: The high-fidelity 3D scene uses the Google Earth-style camera model, featuring smooth LERP interpolation for cinematic zoom transitions on click.

üõ∞Ô∏è Core Features
Feature	Description	Technical Implementation
Dual Classification	Distinguishes between validated discoveries and hypothetical candidates using transparent color coding.	Real (Yellow) vs. Hypothetical (Red) flags; isReal boolean in data model.
Interactive Camera	Seamlessly zooms and tracks any selected planet with a smooth, non-linear (eased) motion.	useFrame hook with lerp() for target and camera position interpolation.
Realistic Orbitals	Orbits are calculated using Kepler's Equation and feature unique 3D inclination (tilt) for a non-flat systemic view.	calculateOrbitalPosition function in orbitalMechanics.ts.
Data Sandbox	Users can upload custom data (CSV/JSON) to instantly test and visualize their own hypothetical exoplanet theories.	DataUploadPanel.tsx with dedicated parsing and spatial distribution algorithms.
Data Aesthetic	Uses a dark, professional, "data scientist" UI with monospace fonts and glassmorphism panels.	Custom UI components (backdrop-blur-md, font-mono).

üõ†Ô∏è Project Architecture
The simulator is built with a modern, component-based front-end framework (implied by the .tsx files) for the interactive 3D environment.

Core Data: exoplanetData.ts defines the planet interface and initial NASA data fetching/fallback logic.

Physics Engine: orbitalMechanics.ts contains the core Kepler's Equation solver and 3D position calculation.

Rendering: ExoplanetScene.tsx manages the main Three.js canvas, camera controls, lighting, and the crucial smooth tracking logic.

UI: Modular components like DataUploadPanel.tsx and TimeControls.tsx manage user interaction.
