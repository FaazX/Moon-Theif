# üåë Moon Thief

**A Revolutionary AI Concept: Accelerating Exoplanet Discovery through 3D Data Visualization.**

-----

## ‚ú® Project Overview

**Moon Thief** is the revolutionary AI concept that's hacking cosmic discovery\! It seamlessly merges a **Structured Algorithmic Classifier** (based on **CNN** principles) with a high-fidelity, interactive **3D Visualization Engine**. Trained on **NASA Exoplanet Archive** data, the project bypasses scientific bottlenecks by instantly classifying exoplanet candidates and presenting them with compelling, **physically accurate orbital simulations** and a **cinematic user experience**.

## üõ∞Ô∏è Core Features & Technical Implementation

| Feature | Description | Technical Implementation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Interactive Camera** | Smoothly tracks any selected planet with a gentle, non-linear (cinematic) motion. | `useFrame` hook with **LERP** (linear interpolation). |
| **Realistic Orbitals** | Orbits calculated using **Kepler's Equation**, showing correct speed and inclination. | `orbitalMechanics.ts` (Physics Engine). |
| **Data Sandbox** | Users upload custom data (CSV/JSON) to instantly test hypothetical theories. | `DataUploadPanel.tsx` with dedicated parsing logic. |
| **Dual Classification** | Transparently separates validated data (Yellow) from user candidates (Red) via AI confidence scoring. | `isReal` boolean + confidence score logic. |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Architecture

The project employs a robust, component-based structure:

1.  **`src/lib/orbitalMechanics.ts`**: Contains the core **Kepler's Equation solver** for all physics and movement.
2.  **`src/lib/exoplanetData.ts`**: Defines the data model and handles NASA data integration.
3.  **`src/components/ExoplanetScene.tsx`**: Manages the 3D rendering, camera controls, and smooth object tracking.
4.  **`DataUploadPanel.tsx`**: Manages user interaction and data ingestion.
